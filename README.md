# VISCA BARCA: ball possession from automatic tracking

Our entry to More than a Hack 2027, Phase 1: one label per frame (`H`, `A` or `D`) for FC Barcelona vs
Athletic Club, produced by an algorithm with no training and no hand labels.

## The method in five lines

1. Stream the automatic tracking into per-frame features: ball position and speed, the nearest player
   of each team, and how closely the ball moves with that player.
2. Detect dead balls from independent cues: ball out, lost at a line or still, collective speed, goals.
3. Find each restart inside the Smart Tagging set-piece windows by the first sharp ball acceleration.
4. Define control as a player within 1.5 m with the ball moving with them for at least 0.5 s.
5. Decode with a three-state Viterbi in which the team can change only at a control event or a restart.

Details: [TECHNICAL_REPORT.md](TECHNICAL_REPORT.md), and every constant in [METHOD.md](METHOD.md).

## Setup

Python 3.11 is required (we used 3.11.15; see `.python-version`).

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it (`.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows, `source .venv/bin/activate` elsewhere), then:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-model.txt
```

## Data

The match data is gated and is not in this repository. After enrolling, put these files in
`data/tactical/`, keeping their names:

```
data/tactical/BAR-ATH_tactical_atd.txt
data/tactical/BAR-ATH_tactical_atd.xml
data/tactical/BAR-ATH_tactical_homography.csv
data/tactical/BAR-ATH_tactical_smart_tagging.xml
```

The homography is listed because it is part of the bundle; the pipeline does not read it.

## Reproduce

```bash
python make_submission.py
```

This runs the full pipeline, writes `submissions/VISCA BARCA.csv`, runs
`evaluation/validate_submission.py` on it and prints its SHA-256. It takes under a minute on a laptop
(14-20 s in our runs, without counting the install).

Expected SHA-256:

```
a93bba3914b38fda65206339f3c54c78f2d204a35b87d84edca101dbb8264dbd
```

The file is written with LF line endings on every OS, so this one hash applies everywhere. Our
reproduction was tested on Windows.

## Tests and label-free checks

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest tests -q
python -m src.possession.diagnostics "submissions/VISCA BARCA.csv"
python -m src.possession.ablation
python scripts/set_piece_profile.py
python scripts/goal_profile.py
```

Everything added by the team is in `make_submission.py`, `src/possession/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`,
`METHOD.md` and `TECHNICAL_REPORT.md`. The organisers' scorer in `evaluation/` is unchanged.

# More than a Hack 2027 — Phase 1: Ball Possession

**Organised by [Metrica Sports](https://metrica-sports.com), [FC Barcelona](https://www.fcbarcelona.com)
and the [Mobile World Capital Barcelona](https://www.mwcbarcelona.com)**, at the Talent Arena in Barcelona.

A football data challenge on real professional match data, open to analysts, data scientists and
engineers. You are given one complete LaLiga match — two camera feeds, automatic tracking of every
player and the ball, automatic tactical tagging, and the camera-to-pitch geometry — and one
question to answer with it.

---

## The task

**For every frame of the match, say who has the ball.**

```
frame,label
11185,A        away in possession, ball alive
11186,A
...
18240,D        dead ball
...
18684,H        home in possession, ball alive
```

That is the whole task. One CSV, one row per video frame, 199,319 rows. It is scored automatically
against a private frame-by-frame ground truth, so there is a number at the end and no argument
about it — no jury, and no presentation to argue from.

The tracking is automatic and uncorrected: it has gaps and identity
switches, and the ball itself is invisible on 41% of the frames you are scored on.

|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input** | one full match: tactical video, broadcast video, automatic tracking **with the ball** for both, Smart Tagging, homography |
| **Output** | `frame,label` CSV, 199,319 rows, labels `H` / `A` / `D` / `X`                                                             |
| **Ranked on** | `spellF1` — how many of the match's real possessions you recovered as whole possessions                                   |
| **Also reported** | `macroF1` — the per-frame view, and the first tie-break                                                                   |
| **Baseline to beat** | `spellF1` **0.2433**, in this repository                                                                                  |
| **Ground truth you get** | the first **5 minutes** of play — to check your pipeline, not to train on                                              |
| **Ground truth you are scored on** | the full match, **private**                                                                                               |

It is deliberately **not** a tracking challenge. The tracking, tagging and homography are given to
you so that nobody has to rebuild detection, re-identification and camera calibration before
getting to the actual question. See [CHALLENGE.md](CHALLENGE.md).

## Try it right now

The scorer, a 5-minute ground truth and four working baselines are in this repository. No
enrolment, no download, no data:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python evaluation/run_evaluation.py
```

Scored on the public 5 minutes, not on the full match -- which is why the order below is not the
order of the floor quoted above:

```
scoreboard  gt/BAR-ATH_possession_gt_public.csv  199319 frames  7500 graded  21 gt segments
ground truth has 17 possessions of mean 14.2 s  <- compare the poss and dur columns

rank  submission                macroF1  spellF1   poss     dur  
----  ------------------------  -------  -------  -----  ------  
   1  baseline_smooth125         0.5812   0.4242     16    18.5  
   2  baseline_smooth50          0.6207   0.3256     26    10.8  
   3  baseline_smooth25          0.6200   0.2868     36     7.6  
   4  baseline_raw               0.5972   0.0378    131     2.0  
```

Those four are **the same algorithm four times** — nearest tracked player to the ball, then a
majority vote over a window. Only the window changes. `macroF1` barely moves; `spellF1` moves by a
factor of eleven. That disagreement is the whole point of the metric, and
[EVALUATION.md](EVALUATION.md) explains it.

Once you have the data, regenerate them yourself and go further:

```bash
python starter/baseline.py                              # rebuild the four baselines
python evaluation/validate_submission.py <your>.csv     # before every submission
```

**Validate every file before you submit it.** `validate_submission.py` runs exactly the checks the
official scorer runs, and a file that fails them is dropped from the board with a one-line reason.
It takes two seconds and it is the single most common way a good entry scores nothing.

The scorer you run locally is the scorer that decides the competition. If it scores on your
machine, it scores the same way on ours.

---

## Requirements

**Python 3.8 or newer.** The evaluation needs `numpy` and `pandas` and nothing else; it is tested
under 3.8 and 3.11 and produces identical output under both. `starter/baseline.py` needs nothing
more either — you can reach a scored submission without installing anything else.

The notebooks additionally want `kloppy` and `matplotlib` (`requirements-starter.txt`), and
**Python 3.9+ is recommended for those**: on Windows, installing Jupyter under 3.8 hits a
`pywinpty` build failure that has nothing to do with this repository.
